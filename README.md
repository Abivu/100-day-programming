# Python workout with mini projects
This repo is a place where I store interesting mini projects which I code the majority under Dr. Angela Yu's guidance (from her famous course 100 Days of Programming - kudos to her and her team). 

I might have added a few extra features in these projects to twist them in my favour. 

1. <b>Snake game</b>

A classic mobile game - coded in OOP style - implemeneted with turtle library. 

Potential extra functionalities:

-  A infor panel for a user choose to play or not.

2. <b>Pong game</b> (Still functions to do)

The most popular game back in the day. An imitation of the table tennis. - coded in OOP style - with turtle library. 

Potential extra functionalities:

- Can I make an PC vs player?!

3. <b>Turtle crossing game</b>

[needs refactoring]

4. <b>Guess the US States name </b>

The educational game challenges a player to type out as many possible states as possible (by using their memories only). And after every game (when click a cancel button), the program will generate a csv file for the states that they miss.

Potential extra functionalities:

- Keep high score
- Save for next game to compare
- Time constraint

5. <b>My very first GUI - Mile to Km Converter </b>

A very simple app to convert Mile to Kilometer. 

Potential extra functionalities:
- Take an "Enter" function.
- Add a canvas to make it more interesting.  

6. <b>Pomodoro clock </b>

An app using a pomodoro technique to encourage a person focus continuously for 25 minutes with interval breaks of 5 minutes in between for short breaks & 20 minutes for long break which happens after every 3 short breaks. Each successful session will be presented with a check mark.This app uses procedural programming and extensively utilizes Tkinter module. 

Potential extra functionalities:
- Different sounds to notify each working and break session.
- A tracking records of working and break sessions by day. 

7. <b>Flashcard app</b>

A flash card app to help students learn and memorize French words. Data uses a list of the most common words in French. There would be 2 buttons - red cross - being pressed if the words are strange and green check - being pressed if the words are known. The words already known would be removed from the list of learning next time. After 3 seconds, the flash card would flip into English translation. 

8. <b>Auto email to send birthday wishes</b>

An app that reads a data file and send birthday wishes to ones who have birthday on that day. 

Potential extra functionalities:

- Include some random photos along with the wish.
