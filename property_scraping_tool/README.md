This is one of the Capstone projects from Angela's 100 days of Code. This project will test my skills on BeautifulSoup & Selenium. <u>What is project about?</u> Utilize Python to scrape all data on a property website. & then write each in a Google Doc form. 

What I have to do in this project:
<ol>

    <li> This data will then be auto written into a form on Google Docs.
    <li> From Google Forms, transform all data received into a single sheet for analysis.
